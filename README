This is a flexible reader for Emacs Lisp.

It allows Common Lisp like read macros, on a per readtable and per buffer
basis.  If the buffer-local variable `use-el-reader' is nil, the built-in reader
is used.  Otherwise this package is used.

To use this reader, put this line anywhere it the file, before using any
el-reader features: (eval-and-compile (setf use-el-reader t))
